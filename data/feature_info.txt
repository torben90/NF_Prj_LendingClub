Main Disc of Task:
1. Lending Club 

For this project we chose a dataset from Lending Club approved personal loans between 2007 and 2011. 
The data can be found on www.lendingclub.com. The purpose of the analysis is to reduce defaults, 
improve profitability and help the company and investors determine interest rates. We will use machine 
learning models to analyze credit risk as a binary classification problem.

How to choose the Performance metrics? - well the model (whichever you pick) will 
be used to determine who should be approved for a loan and who shouldnâ€™t, denying the loan to a 
client who will end up paying in full (false positives) represents a loss, but because interest is 
usually only a portion of principal the company will most likely be more comfortable not taking the
chance when the risk is not to get reimbursed at all and lose the entire principal which represents a higher amount. 
Thus the main concern here is to avoid approving somebody who won't be able to repay or in other words avoid 
false negatives. This is achieved by a model with a high recall rate. 
What would be right performance metric- precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, or something else?

We also might need to evaluate TPR to make sure we are not declined too many qualified borrowers.


Make sure to check data imbalance.

 interest (fee charged for borrowing)
  > This means the monthly interest amount declines over time as the outstanding principal declines.



Lending Club is a peer-to-peer loan company. 
It runs an online marketplace to match borrowers with lenders. 
Borrowers apply for loans ranging from $1,000 to $35,000. 
If the application is approved, Lending Club will offer a loan whose interest rate is 
based on submitted information and credit history. The process is largely automated, 
reducing overhead costs that banks typically incur. 
Peer-to-peer loan companies claim that they can therefore offer better rates for borrowers.

Individuals interested in lending to these borrowers can fund these loans in $25 increments. 
When browsing loans on the online marketplace, investors will see the following page:
